# Simon

This is a project where, despite there are lots of posts on web on it. Seemed challenging to build it by myself, tryng to give a nice and subtle look tribute to it. 

Here I applied a carefull treatment of CSS in order to align perfectly each quarter of the SIMON PLATE, which was very defying.

And, of course, writting the Js script added to make the game come alive... fluent con coherent with the traditional memory game.  I think this.game (if u try to build as I did without tutorials) is a good test to improve and consolidate DOM manipulation, functions, callstacks, timers, and loops.

Hope u like my code...

Thanks for reading.
